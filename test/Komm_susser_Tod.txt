I know, I know I've let you down
I've been a fool to myself
I thought that I could
Live for no one else

But now through all the hurt and pain
Its time for me to respect
The ones you love
Mean more than anything

So with sadness in my heart
I feel the best thing I could do
Is end it all
And leave forever
Whats done is done, it feels so bad
What once was happy now is sad
I'll never love again
My world is ending

I wish that I could turn back time
'cause now the guilt is all mine
Can't live without the trust from those you love
I know we can't forget the past
You can't forget love and pride
Because of that it's killing me inside
It all returns to nothing, it all comes
Tumbling down, tumbling down
Tumbling down
It all returns to nothing, I just keep
Letting me down, letting me down
Letting me down
In my heart of hearts
I know that I could never love again
I've lost everything
Everything, everything
That matters to me
Matters in this world

I wish that I could turn back time
'cause now all the guilt is mine
Can't live without
The trust from those you love
I know we can't forget the past
We can't forget love and pride
Because of that, its killing me inside

It all returns to nothing, it all comes
Tumbling down, tumbling down
Tumbling down
It all returns to nothing, I just keep
Letting me down, letting me down
Letting me down
It all returns to nothing, it all comes
Tumbling down, tumbling down
Tumbling down
It all returns to nothing, I just keep
Letting me down, letting me down
Letting me down
